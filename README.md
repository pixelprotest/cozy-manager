# Cozy Manager

Cozy Manager is an AI Model Manager command line tool.

## Key features:
- üìö Keep track of your entire model collection, never having to manually download the same model twice.
- üöÄ Simple command to deploy your model collection on new machines.
- üè∑Ô∏è Automatically renames ambiguous model names to more descriptive names. e.g. `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors`..
- üìÅ Automatically organizes your models in sub directories e.g. `/root/lora/flux1`
- üí∞ Save money on GBs of cloud storage, by easily freeing up diskspace.
- üåê Download from multiple sources, including Hugging Face and Civitai.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pixelprotest/cozy-manager.git
   cd cozy-manager 
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
   ```
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   CIVITAI_API_KEY=your_civitai_api_key
   MODEL_INFO_FILE=/path/to/model_info.json
   MODEL_STORAGE_DIR=/path/to/model/storage/directory
   ```


## Quick Start
Follow the installation instructions above, then to download your first model:

`cozy download <url> <type> <base> <optional local filename>`
- url: could be a huggingface url to a .safetensors file or a generic civitai model page url
- type: can be a model type like `lora`, `vae`, `controlnet`, etc
- base: can be a model base like `sdxl`, `sd1.5`, `sd1.0`, etc
- optional local filename: if you want to store the model with a different name than the original filename


`cozy unload` clear out disk space and remove all locally stored models: 

`cozy reload` reload all previously downloaded models

`cozy list` list all the models in your collection

`cozy edit <id>` edit the db entry for a model this will open a command line prompt asking you what you want to edit, it will walk you through some options:
- add / remove / clear tags
- change the local filename
- change the model type
- change the model base
- remove the model from the collection



### 1. Download a model

To download a model, the basic command is:

`cozy download <url> <model-type> <model-base-type> <optional filename>` 

For example lets say we want to download a `sdxl` `lora` from civitai, 
we can copy the url and download it on the cli like this:

`cozy download https://civitai/path/to/lora/here lora sdxl`

Or lets say we want to download the `flux1-dev` `ae.safetensors` file from huggingface.
The original `ae.safetensors` filename is a bit ambiguous, so we can pass in a new name
to store it like `flux1-dev-ae.safetensors`

`cozy https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev/blob/main/ae.safetensors vae flux1 flux1-dev-ae.safetensors`

The `model-type` and the `model-base-type` will create subdirectories in the `MODEL_STORAGE_DIR`

if no `--model-type` and no `--model-base` are passed int, it will automatically try to distill 
the type and base for you.


### 2. Unload Models 

You can clear up disk space by unloading models from your drive. If you run the unload command it will remove all the locally stored models from your drive. e.g.

`cozy unload`

`cozy unload --tag <tag>` unload all the models with a specific tag

`cozy unload --model-type <model-type>` unload all the models with a specific model type

`cozy unload --model-base <model-base>` unload all the models with a specific model base


### 3. Reload Models

Since all the information of our previously downloaded models are stored in a json file, 
we can redownload all the models by running:

`cozy reload`

`cozy reload --tag <tag>` reloads all the models with a specific tag

`cozy reload --model-type <model-type>` reloads all the models with a specific model type

`cozy reload --model-base <model-base>` reloads all the models with a specific model base

### 5. List Models

`cozy list --all`

`cozy list --loaded` list the ones that are currently downloaded locally

`cozy list --unloaded` list the ones that are in the collection but _not_ downloaded

`cozy list --data` list the size of the models stored locally 


### 6. Edit Mode

`cozy edit <id>`

this will open a command line prompt asking you what you want to edit, it will walk you through some options
